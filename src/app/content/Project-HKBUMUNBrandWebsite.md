## Introduction

I took upon the initiative of developing the HKBUMUN Conference Website after seeing a need to make the image of our conference more professional and to make information—such as delegate resources—readily available to the participants.

## Tech Stack

I used **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS** primarily. This is a front-end website mainly because there was no need for a database or any advanced features.

## Structure

The project codebase is organized into the following pages:

- **Home Page**
- **About Page**
- **Committees Page**
- **Resources Page**

We use a React component–based structure to simplify development.

**Components Made:**

1. **AnimatedButtons** – Displays numbers on the About Page.
2. **Card** – Cards on the Home Page leading to About, Committee, and Resources pages.
3. **CommitteeBlock** – Blocks on the Committee Page.
4. **Footer** – Used on all pages.
5. **Hero** – Home Page front cover.
6. **Navbar** – Used on every page.

## Core Learning

From this project, I solidified my skills in Next.js and TailwindCSS, but most importantly, I learned how to design. All the images used in the website were photographed by the EXCO of the club. I enhanced these pictures by applying effects, choosing the right ones, and aligning them with the overall background theme.

My second biggest learning was discovering that Safari processes transparency and blur properties differently. I had to use WebKit-specific properties to ensure compatibility on iPhones as well.

## Conclusion

I realized I love doing projects that add value. I once again thank the EXCO Members of HKBUMUN Club for supporting this initiative and trusting me with it!
